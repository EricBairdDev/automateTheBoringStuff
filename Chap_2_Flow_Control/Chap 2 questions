Q: 1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True and False, always with a capital

Q: 2. What are the three Boolean operators?
and, or, not

Q: 3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible
combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

and

True and True = True
True and False = False
False and True = False
False and False = False

or

True or False = True
True or True = True
False or True = True
False or False = False

not

not True = False
not False = True


Q: 4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) False
not (5 > 4) False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5) ) False
(True and True) and (True == False) False
(not False) or (not True) True


Q: 5. What are the six comparison operators?
+, -, >, < , ==, !=, <=, >=


Q: 6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment
operator?

== is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean,
while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.


Q: 7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
A condition is an expression used in flow control statements that evaluate to a boolean value


Q: 8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs') <----
if spam > 5:
print('bacon') <-----
else:
print('ham')  <----
print('spam') <----
print('spam') <----


Q: 9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in
spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

Q: 10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

ctrl + C

Q: 11. What is the difference between break and continue?
Break ends a loop, continue begins teh loop from the beginning.

Q: 12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)
in a for loop?

range(10) = from 0-9
range(0, 10) = starting at zero until 9
range(0, 10, 1) = starting from 0 to 9 by intervals of 1
All do the same thing

Q: 13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then
write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1


Q: 14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how
would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
